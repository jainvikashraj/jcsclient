NAME :
    create-key-pair

DESCRIPTION :
    Creates a new 2048 bit RSA key pair which registers the public key
    part and returns the private key. The private key can be saved in
    a .pem file and this can be used during instance creation to
    finally access the instance once launched.

    Please note that JCS doesnt keep any copy of private key. Thus, if
    lost, it cannot be restored back.

SYNOPSIS :
    create-key-pair
    --key-name <value>

OPTIONS :
    --key-name:
    Unique name for the key pair being created.

EXAMPLES :
    jcs compute create-key-pair --key-name abc
