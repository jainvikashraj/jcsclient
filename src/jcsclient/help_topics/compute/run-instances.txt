NAME :
    run-instances

DESCRIPTION :
    Creates and starts a JCS Compute instance in your account.
    For this to be successful, you need to have enough instance
    quota in your account.

    When an instance gets created, it enters in pending state.
    After the creation and launch is successful, the instance
    enters in running state. Please contact customer support if
    the instance remains in pending state for long.

SYNOPSIS :
    run-instances
    --image-id <value>
    --instance-type-id <value>
    [--block-device-mappings <list>]
    [--instance-count <integer>]
    [--subnet-id <value>]
    [--private-ip-address <value>]
    [--security-group-ids <list>]
    [--key-name <value>]

OPTIONS :
    --image-id
    Unique identifier for Image selected for the instance.

    --instance-type-id
    Unique identifer for Instance type selected for the instance.

    --block-device-mappings
    List of settings to be used for volumes being created during
    instance launch. This itself is a structure which supports the
    following options.
        DeleteOnTermination
        VolumeSize
        DeviceName
        SnapshotId
    Please refer to the Compute help guide for more information on
    how to work with these parameters.
    If not specified, JCS takes the boot volume information from the
    OS image properties.

    --instance-count
    Integer representing how many instances to be launched. Default
    is 1.

    --subnet-id
    Unique identifier for the subnet where the instance is created.
    Incase one doesnt provide this value, an appropriate subnet is
    selected.

    --private-ip-address
    Valid IP address from the subnet CIDR block. If not given, an
    available private IP address is selected.

    --security-group-ids
    One or more security groups to be associated to the instance.
    If not given, default security group is associated with the
    instance.

    --key-name
    Key Name to be used while launching the instance. If not given
    instance can be still launched but not reached.

EXAMPLES :
    jcs compute run-instances --image-id jmi-xxxx
                              --instance-type-id c1.small

    jcs compute run-instances --image-id jmi-xxxx
                              --instance-type-id c1.small
                              --key-name abc
                              --security-groups sg-123 sg-456

    jcs compute run-instances --image-id jmi-xxxx 
                              --instance-type-id c1.small
                              --key-name abc
                              --subnet-id subnet-1234

    jcs compute run-instances --image-id xxxx
                              --instance-type-id c1.small
                              --key-name abc
                              --block-device-mappings "DeviceName=/dev/vda,DeleteOnTermination=true,VolumeSize=20"
