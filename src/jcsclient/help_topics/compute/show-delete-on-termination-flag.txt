NAME :
    show-delete-on-termination-flag

DESCRIPTION :
    This API provides the status of whether the DeleteOnTermination
    flag has been set or unset for a particular volume. If true, this
    volume gets deleted once the particular instance to which the 
    volume was attached is terminated.

    This parameter for a volume only makes sense when the volumes are
    attached to some instance. If not attached, an exception gets
    thrown if this API is checked for the flag.

SYNOPSIS :
    show-delete-on-termination-flag
    --volume-id <value>

OPTIONS :
    --volume-id
    Particular volume id to be checked for the DeleteOnTermination
    flag.

EXAMPLES :
    jcs compute show-delete-on-termination-flag --volume-id abc
