NAME :
    get-password-data

DESCRIPTION :
    Retrieves the decrypted password for an instance that was
    launched with Windows image.

    By default the password is encrypted. To decrypt it, one
    must provide the private key file. And if the private key
    file has a passphrase, the passphrase also needs to be
    given, else the decryption fails and exception is raised.

    If no private key file is given as input, then encrypte
    password is returned to the user.

    If the specified instance is not of Windows type, then the
    password returned is empty.
